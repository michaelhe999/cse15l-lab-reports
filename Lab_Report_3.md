## Part 1 - Bugs

### Bug with reverseInPlace

#### Failure inducing input: 
input: {0,1,2,3,4} expected: {4,3,2,1,0} output: {4,3,2,3,4}
```
@Test 
  public void testReversedWorking(){
      int[] input = {0,1,2,3,4};
      int[] output = {4,3,2,1,0};
      ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input);
      assertArrayEquals(output, input);
  }
```
#### Passing input: 
input: {0} expected: {0} output: {0}
```
@Test 
  public void testReversedWorking(){
      int[] input = {0};
      int[] output = {0};
      ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input);
      assertArrayEquals(output, input);
  }
```
#### Symptoms:
##### Failing Input:
![Image](FailingInputTestRun.png)
##### Passing Input:
![Image](PassingInputTestRun.png)

#### Buggy Code:
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length/2; i += 1) {
        arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
        arr[arr.length - i - 1] = arr[i];
    }
  }
```
#### Fixed Code: 
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length/2; i += 1) {
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
        arr[arr.length - i - 1] = temp;
    }
  }
```
For the reverseInPlace function, the bug is that the method rewrites its elements as it is trying to reverse, and thus later elements are never actually reversed. The fix is setting temporary values, such that the actual element that should be switched between two indexes is saved elsewhere and not overwritten. 

## Part 2 - Researching commands

### grep command options:

#### -i 

Finds the lines in a file with the given pattern, ignoring cases. Outputs all the lines. [1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/#)
```
michaelhe@MacBook-Pro-3 docsearch % grep -i "dna strand" technical/biomed/1471-2091-3-13.txt
        circle, instead of the complementary DNA strand through the
        the cleaved DNA gate strand while the passing DNA strand
```
This command outputs all the lines in a file with the given pattern. In this case, it could be used to quickly search for lines in the file to find answers to questions about DNA strands. 

```
michaelhe@MacBook-Pro-3 docsearch % grep -i "dna strand" technical/biomed/*.txt

```
This command outputs all the lines in all the files in the biomed directory with the give pattern, as well as giving the file the line is in, regardless of case. In this case, it can search for any case in any file with the pattern, to not only find answers to questions but also be able to list the sources. 

#### -w

Finds the lines in a file with the pattern as a word, not just as a segment of a string. [1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/#)
```
michaelhe@MacBook-Pro-3 docsearch % grep -w "and" technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-3.txt

This output all the lines in the file with the word "and". This is useful when looking for word counts (could not work if word appears twice in a line), or if looking for cases where two things are presented in the same line through a conjunction.

This output all the lines and files where the lines occur with the word "moreover", only lowercased. It could be useful when only looking for cases where a certain word appears, as well as looking for the lines where it appears. 

#### -C(n)

Like the -i command, this command is useful to finding answers to questions about DNA strands. It is more useful because it also gives context to the line.

```
Using the command with multiple files, the command also outputs the file where the lines are found. Again, this is useful for searching multiple files to find information about DNA strands.

#### -o
The -o command prints out all the occurences of the given pattern. [1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/#)
```
michaelhe@MacBook-Pro-3 docsearch % grep -o "DNA strand" technical/biomed/1471-2091-3-13.txt

DNA strand
```
This command may be useful to count the number of times a certain pattern occurs in a file. This could be useful if you want to find/replace information. 
```
michaelhe@MacBook-Pro-3 docsearch % grep -o "DNA strand" technical/biomed/*.txt

technical/biomed/1472-6750-2-13.txt:DNA strand
technical/biomed/1476-4598-2-3.txt:DNA strand
```
This command done over multiple files also outputs the files where the pattern occurs. Aside from the usage in the previous example, it can also be used to see if a file has multiple occurences of a pattern.
